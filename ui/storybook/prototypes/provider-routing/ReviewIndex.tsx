          Start with Default path or Happy path walkthrough in Onboarding, then
          Codex new runner or Claude default in Agent. Sign in with the normal
          account, choose a model, and test. The Connection dropdown lists saved
          connections compatible with the harness, including configured
          gateways. Provider URLs, custom provider setup, and custom model entry
          stay behind an explicit Advanced action.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Advanced providers stories show the expanded controls. Configured
          gateway shows the everyday view after setup: the connection name and
          selected model remain visible while its technical settings are folded
          away. Closing Advanced preserves every selection and validation error.

        <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
          Agent settings live at Agents → Nova → Harness / Runtime. The Agent
          stories render the existing settings page, sidebar, and header, with
          the proposed connection controls in its runtime section.

          Manage uses the existing Connectors provider cards and account rows.
          Setup reuses the Access cards, agent picker, and API key form. Agent
          selection uses the existing harness dropdown, connection choices,
          model picker, and test card. Recovery uses the existing inline Fix
          connection flow. Destination and model routing fields are the proposed
          additions.

        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5 text-sm">
          <li>
            The connection owns the destination and authentication. The agent
            owns its harness and selected model.
          </li>
          <li>
            First onboarding keeps its usual sign-in path. The optional provider
            link is inside Advanced; the catalog opens each provider directly. Permissions stay under Advanced.
          </li>
          <li>
            Changing a connection preserves the harness and asks for a
            compatible model when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tests run in the selected environment. A key being accepted does not
            establish model/tool compatibility.
          </li>
          <li>
            A new endpoint creates a new connection; changing a personal default
            never silently selects another destination.
